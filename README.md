# H4X0R-News
My Fourth SwiftUI App

## Learned about...
+ `List` table view analog
  - `Identifiable` protocol to serve `List` and etc... 
  - `Identifiable` you can use id also as computed property `var id: String { objectID }`
+ `NavigationView`
  - `.navigationBarTitle("H4X0R News")` it should be placed before ending brace of `NavigationView`
  - For now unable to change navigation bar background color
